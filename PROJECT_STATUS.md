## 💡 Tips for Development

1. **Test with real data**: Create some users, boards, and pins via Django admin
2. **Use Django Debug Toolbar**: Already installed at `/__debug__/`
3. **Check errors**: Django shows detailed error pages in DEBUG mode
4. **Git commits**: Make regular commits as you add features
5. **Environment variables**: Never commit `.env` file with secrets

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### MySQL Connection Issues:
- Ensure MySQL is running on port 3306
- Verify database `somrosly_db` exists
- Check credentials in `.env` file

### Migration Errors:
```bash
python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
```

### Static Files Not Loading:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```
